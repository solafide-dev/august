# August

August is a persistant data storage library that is based around folders and flat files (JSON, YAML, ect).

Its main purpose is to provide a data store that is human readable and interactable, at the cost of speed and size.

## Usage

For a full example of usage, see the [example](example) folder.

## Why the name August?

August is named after Saint Augustine of Hippo.

Saint Augustine of Hippo was a philosopher and theologian who lived from 354 to 430 AD. He is considered one of the most important figures in the development of Western Christianity and was a major figure in bringing Christianity to dominance in the previously pagan Roman Empire.

This has nothing to do with storing data, but I needed a name and I like the name August.
